# Crystal version 

`crystal gb.cr` to run interpreted

`crystal build gb.cr -o gbb` to compile


The crystal value propositions

1. Speed - faster than ruby (closer to c-interop )
2. > 90% Similar syntax to ruby - Where it matters, defining functions, blocks, calling methods, defining classes, modules How you structure your program in the large is very similar to ruby 
3. Type system suprisingly helpful (and is kind of a static type checker for ruby)
